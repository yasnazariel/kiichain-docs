# What is KiiChain?

### What is KiiChain?

KiiChain is a layer 1 blockchain built with the Cosmos SDK. It blends EVM compatibility with multi-chain connectivity to create a network that is highly interoperable, scalable and easy to use. Its design purpose is to onboard the next generation of developers in emerging markets who are building the best use-cases for real-world users.&#x20;

### Cosmos SDK

The Cosmos SDK is an open-source framework for building multi-asset public Proof-of-Stake (PoS) blockchains, like the Cosmos Hub.The goal of the Cosmos SDK is to allow developers to easily create custom blockchains from scratch that can natively interoperate with other blockchains. We envision the Cosmos SDK as the npm-like framework to build secure blockchain applications on top of CometBFT. SDK-based blockchains are built out of composable modules, most of which are open-source and readily available for any developers to use. The Cosmos SDK is a capabilities-based system that allows developers to better reason about the security of interactions between modules. Learn more about Cosmos [here](https://docs.cosmos.network/).

### Comet BFT & Tendermint Core

Comet BFT (Byzantine Fault Tolerant) is the upgraded version of Tendermint Core, the Interchain’s consensus mechanism that powers Cosmos SDK blockchain systems. Comet BFT has a modular architecture that separates the consensus engine from the application layer, allowing developers to build custom blockchain applications easily. It offers fast transaction finality and high throughput, making it ideal for applications that require quick and reliable performance. Learn more about Comet BFT [here](https://cometbft.com/).

### Proof-of-Stake

KiiChain is a Proof-of-Stake blockchain. PoS selects validators based on the number of tokens they hold and are willing to "stake" as collateral for servicing and securing the network. Delegators, or individual "stakers", can delegate their tokens to any specific validator that meets the requirements.&#x20;

### Kii RWA Protocol

The Kii RWA Protocol sets standardization of Real World Asset (RWA) tokenization through the T-REX (Token for Regulated EXchanges) protocol using CosmWasm smart contracts on KiiChain that are simultaneously mirrored to ERC tokens. The T-REX protocol is designed for compliant issuance and management of security tokens on blockchain networks. Apart from token standards, the protocol defines on-chain KYC, KYB and asset verification. The Kii RWA protocol on KiiChain is creating an interoperable unified liquidity layer for RWA tokens.&#x20;

### Kii Payfi Module

The Kii PayFi Module is a gas-optimized payment system for merchant transactions with specialized fee handling along with a Paymaster System to grant gas funds for DeFi actions via protocols. The module is developed for both web3 and web2 companies to incentivize the migration of their revenue and payment models to on-chain functions. Included in the module, is a Defi protocol that sets standards for TVL based loans, collateral management, interest models, and liquidity systems. Advanced features include revenue lending, invoicing financing, payment scheduling and TVL based credit card financing through community Payfi pools. This module is still in development and will be deployed in the coming weeks.&#x20;

### Mirrored EVM Module

The Sei EVM module allows for mirrored EVM compatibility and for smart contracts to be deployed in Solidity to the network. This means it can run all existing Ethereum dApps and smart contracts without needing any changes. It achieves this with a high-performance Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) that is optimized for speed and reliability. Essentially, Sei EVM runs an Ethereum-compatible virtual machine side chain that mirrors address balances between EVM and Cosmwasm tokens. Thanks to its modular, plugin-based design, it allows any host blockchain to execute Ethereum transactions and smart contracts.&#x20;

### IBC

Inter-Blockchain Communication is a protocol that allows for cross chain communication and data transfers. It connects different blockchain networks to promote high levels of interoperability, scalability and communication. IBC can be implemented to any blockchain network as long as it conforms to its protocol guidelines. Currently, there are over 100 networks integrated into IBC.
