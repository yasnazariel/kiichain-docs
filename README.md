# What is KIIEX?

### What is KIIEX

KIIEX is an on-chain FX desk powering global payments, trading and finance solutions in an easy to use platform designed for everyone. Users, businesses or builders can use KIIEX by signing up for an account or connecting to APIs. KIIEX differs from other traditional platforms by its hybrid approach of sourcing liquidity and maintaining balances on-chain exposed to local currencies. KIIEX supports fiat swaps and payins/payouts via the pricing of local, non-dollar stablecoins and other tokenized real-world assets.&#x20;

### Hybrid Matching Engine

At the core of KIIEX is a hybrid matching engine that is able to source on-chain liquidity across any blockchain ecosystem while using centralized pricing to hedge and rebalance on-chain positions. The result is a ultra-liquid layer that can operate 24/7 on certain pairs that only have liquidity during traditional business hours.&#x20;

### Ramps&#x20;

KIIEX has a full suite of on and off ramps enabling instant payins and payouts from its system. These ramps are both UI and API enabled with the ability to disperse directly or to third-pary accounts while remaining 100% compliant.&#x20;

### Connect to APIs

KIIEX has developed a suite of APIs that embed all centralized and decentralized functionalities into a single set of APIs that any application can use. For more informaiton on the APIs, visit:
