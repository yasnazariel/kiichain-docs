  KII's value is derived from its Utility rather than a speculative investment.
  Here are the utility use cases for KII, outlining its value in the real-world
  and to the network.

# Utility

1. KIIEX Benefits: KII holders will have reduced trading fees and cash-in/cash-out rates within the ecosystem. Users who remit funds in KII will have priority to liquidity and rates, especially within our ecosystem of partners.
2. KIIEX Incentives: KII will be used to create incentives for on-chain PayFi liquidity pools, designed specially to incentivize stablecoin liquidity when creating pools on the less demanded side of the trade. (ie: USDT / COP – higher need for COP liquidity than USDT liquidity, therefore those that create COP liquidity pools will receive KII incentives and greater spreads).
3. Payment for the use of the KiiChain RWA protocol: Payment for use of the RWA protocol and “unified liquidity” swaps to over 100+ networks will be in KII token relative to bps on total AUM of for permissioned tokens. Example: 10bps of the nominal asset value paid in KII from the liquidity sourced from an RWA purchase.
4. Pricing of Assets on KIIEX: Tokenized commodities and products can be priced in KII to create instant/easier liquidity in our hybrid CEX/DEX from native liquidity pools.
5. Collateral: KII will be used as a collateral on DeFi apps, liquid staking, lending, and futures settlement.
6. Staking: KII is required for validators and delegators to participate in the network. KII is the only token eligible for validating and delegating in KiiChain.
7. Rewards: KII is rewarded to validators and delegators for their service to the network.
8. Gas fees: KII is used for transaction fees. All transactions such as deployment of new smart contracts, creation of user accounts, or token transfer, require the payer to pay transaction fees in KII.
9. Governance: KII will be used for voting on future protocol and ecosystem development once the blockchain migrates to open governance.
