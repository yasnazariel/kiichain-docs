# Vision of KiiChain

### FX settlement layer for Stablecoins and tokenized Real-World Assets

KiiChain is a supercharged unified liquidity network for international trade, finance and payments – specifically built for emerging markets. It seamlessly melds with prevailing payment infrastructures, aiming to alleviate the exorbitant costs and reduce barriers in global economic transactions. Unlike other monolithic blockchain layers, KiiChain is purpose-built for emerging markets and “last mile” integrations into local economies, breathing life into previously liquidity-constrained sectors that cannot financially communicate with the rest of the world.&#x20;

The blockchain rides on the back of the CometBFT consensus mechanism built with the Cosmos SDK - a testament to its decentralization and commitment to achieve lightning-fast finality and minuscule network fees. Primarily, its design suits the daily exigencies of emerging economies, taking into account the wealth imbalances that exist. KiiChain’s Comet consensus mechanism boasts supercar-fast validators that produce blocks in seconds, allowing for instantaneous cross-chain settlement times and a fee on the network less than one peso.

The Kii blueprint saw expansion within its product and app suite, incorporating custom on-chain protocols and modules to allow any user, builder or business to connect directly to the network. KiiChains flagship native app, KIIEX, is a hybrid centralized-decentralized exchange specifically conceptualized for liquidity assimilations in RWA and payment settlement. KiiChain is amplified by a series of protocols and modules that provide interconnectivity between Ethereum, Solana, Cosmos and more – providing unified access to tradeable assets across ecosystems on one network.&#x20;

The product suite provides institutional infrastructure and liquidity, connecting global players to local operators. KiiChain is EVM compatible and supports smart contracts in both Solidity and Rust. It’s a permissionless ecosystem for open finance, where web2 and web3 developers can build a wide variety of dApps and protocols.
