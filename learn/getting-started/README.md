# Getting Started

### KiiChain Testnet Oro

Oro Testnet is the final upgraded testnet before mainnet. Users and builders can interact and build with this testnet's latest features. Oro testnet will also run incentivization programs.

For on-chain activities, activations, airdrops and more, join our open testnet here:

* [**Testnet Oro**](https://kiichain.io/testnet)

### Get a wallet in Testnet

Testnet Oro supports wallet connections with EVM and Cosmos based wallets like MetaMask and Keplr . To set up a wallet, make sure you have the MetaMask or Keplr wallet extension downloaded in your web browser. MetaMask supports extension downloads for the following web browsers: Chrome, Firefox, Brave, Edge and Opera. Kelpr supports wallets in Chrome, Firefox and Edge.

For further explanation of how to set up your wallet, follow the steps [here](https://docs.kiiglobal.io/docs/getting-started/set-up-a-web-wallet) or connect your testnet wallet to our explorer app automatically by following the steps [here](https://docs.kiiglobal.io/docs/getting-started/connect-wallet-to-explorer-app).

### Get Testnet tokens

Testnet Oro tokens are available in our [Discord faucet](https://discord.com/invite/kiichain) or in the Explorer App. Once you have created a wallet, you can automatically request and receive 2,500 tokens within a 24 hour period. For any developers who would like more tokens, please request a bulk amount in our Discord channels. \\

The command for requesting tokens in our Discord faucet channel is:

```
$request {address}
```

Example EVM:

```
$request Ox12345abcde…
```

Example Cosmos Address:

```
$request kii12345abcde…

### How to stake your tokens

Tokens can be staked in the Explorer App by connecting your wallet and delegating to an active validator. Make sure the wallet you have connected to the Explorer App is funded with tokens.

### Connect wallet to Explorer App

The Explorer App can be automatically connected to MetaMask or Keplr via the RPC endpoints. Once you have installed the MetaMask extension, follow the steps [here](https://docs.kiiglobal.io/docs/getting-started/connect-wallet-to-explorer-app) to connect your wallet and begin delegating.
