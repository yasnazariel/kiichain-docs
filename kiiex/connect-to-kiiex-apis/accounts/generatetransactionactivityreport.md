# GenerateTransactionActivityReport

**Category:** User\
**Permissions:** Operator, Trading\
**Call Type:** Synchronous

Generates an immediate report on account transaction activity for a list of accounts under a single Order Management System during a specified time. A user with Trading permission can only generate reports for accounts with which he is associated; a user with Operator permission can generate reports for accounts associated with others. There can be multiple users associated with an account.

The Transaction Activity Report is delivered as a comma-separated (CSV) file. For specific CSV formatting information, see the APEX Extract CSV Data Dictionary, available from AlphaPoint.

Similar objects are returned for **Generate\~Report** and **Schedule\~Report** calls. As a result, for an on-demand **Generate\~Repor**t call, some string-value pairs such as _initialRunTime_ may return the current time and _ReportFrequency_ will always return _OnDemand_ because the report is only generated once and on demand.

| intervalDuration  | <p><strong>long integer.</strong> The period that the report covers relative to the run date. The <strong>Generate~Report</strong> call requires a start time and an end time. The AlphaPoint software calculates the difference between them as <em>intervalDuration</em>.<br><br>For example, say that you specify a 90-day start-date-to-end-date window for a report. The <em>intervalDuration</em> value returns a value equivalent to 90 days. If you have called <strong>Generate~Report</strong>, that value simply confirms the length of time that the on-demand report covers.</p> |
