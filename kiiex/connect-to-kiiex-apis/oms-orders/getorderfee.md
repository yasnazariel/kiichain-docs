# GetOrderFee

**Category:** User\
**Permissions:** Operator, Trading\
**Call Type:** Synchronous

Returns an estimate of the transaction fee for a specific order side, instrument, and order type. Fees are set and calculated by the operator of the trading venue.

The exchange generally deducts fees from the "receiving" side of the trade (although an operator can modify this). There are two products in every trade (and in every instrument); for example, the instrument BTCUSD comprises a BitCoin product and a US dollar product. Placing a buy order on the book causes fees to be deducted from Product 1, in this case, BitCoin; placing a sell order causes fees to be deducted from Product 2, in this case, US dollar.

A user with Trading permission can get fee estimates for any account that user is associated with and for any instrument or product that that account can trade; a user with Operator permission can get fee estimates for any account, instrument, or product.

If loyalty token is enabled and there is no market for the loyalty token, the system automatically uses 3rd party rates for the loyalty token market.
