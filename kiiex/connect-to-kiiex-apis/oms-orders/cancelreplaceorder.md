# CancelReplaceOrder

**Category:** User\
**Permissions:** Operator, Trading\
**Call Type:** Synchronous

**CancelReplaceOrder** is a single API call that both cancels an existing order and replaces it with a new order. Canceling one order and replacing it with another also cancels the order’s priority in the order book. You can use **ModifyOrder** to preserve priority in the book; but **ModifyOrder** only allows a reduction in order quantity.

**Warning:** **CancelReplaceOrder** sacrifices the order's priority in the order book.
