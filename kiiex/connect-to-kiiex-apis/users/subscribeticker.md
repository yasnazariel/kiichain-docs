The response returns an array of objects , each object an unlabeled, comma-delimited array of numbers. The Open price and Close price are those at the beginning of the tick — the Interval time subscribed to in the request. For 24-hour exchanges, the trading day runs from UTC midnight to UTC midnight; highs, lows, opens, closes, and volumes consider that midnight-to-midnight period to be the trading day. The data order is:

* date/time UTC in milliseconds since 1/1/1970
* high
* low
* open
* close
* volume
* inside bid price
* inside ask price
* instrument ID

A typical response might look like this: `[[1510719222970.21,6943.51,6890.27,6898.41,6891.16,0,6890.98,6891.98,1,1510718681956.34]],`
